[![Core.js](https://github.com/rblalock/core/raw/master/corejs.png)](https://github.com/rblalock/core)

Core.js is a boilerplate for [Titanium Alloy](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy). Use it to quickly start building applications without all the overhead of having to create screen management methods, utility functions and device detection.

Getting Started
===============

The `lib` folder is where the core.js singleton and the helpers are located.  Copy this in to
your Alloy project to start using.

If you want to run the sample apps: Clone this repository into your Titanium Studio Workspace:

```
	cd ~/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace
	git clone git@github.com:rblalock/core.git
```

Now you can open Titanium Studio and import the project, which is in the `demo_app` folder (it's where the app is):

```
	File > Importâ€¦ > Existing Mobile Project > Select the demo_app folder
```

You'll need to tick the `Copy project into workspace` option in the import window.

At this point you should have the project imported, open, and ready to edit.

Examples
===================
We made it easy to run these examples all in one Ti project.  First, import this app in to Studio,
then in the root project, open `/app/config.json` and change the name of the `"examples"`
property to the example you want to run.

e.g. Change the name to "simple" to run the simple sample app.

If you want to use the example in your project, there are two ways to do this:

1.  Copy the example from `/demo_app/examples/yourDesiredExample` to your project's `app` folder
2.  Alternatively, you can remove the `alloy.jmk` file in the demo app so it doesn't keep pulling from
the examples folder.

## Current examples:

### simple

This is a simple example using core.js.  Nothing fancy, just a bare bone example of Core which
implements and tests the basic methods in Core.js.  It also has a simple starting place for a
navigation strategy.

### viewNavigation

This example uses a view-based navigation architecture. A view-based navigation architecture
means there is only one main window and views are moved in and out of a stack when navigating
the app.

### standardNavigation

This example uses the standard navigation architectures for Android and iOS.
e.g. NavigationWindow for iOS and the ActionBar for Android.

Generated Documentation
===================

1. Install JSDuck for doc generation
2. Run this command from your project root dir: `jsduck ./lib --config ./documentation/jsduck.json`
3. The documentation html will be in `documentation/generatedDocumentation`

High-Level Overview
===================

##### core.js

The `/app/lib/core.js` file is home to the bulk of the boilerplate (hence the name). It provides access to commonly used methods including:

 * Device information
 * Network connection information
 * Global event handlers (resume, exit, orientation change, etc.)
 * Screen management via the Navigator object (which should be a module specific to your navigation
 strategy).

Any methods you create that are used throughout the application and relate to any of these
functions should probably also be included in the `core.js` file.

##### http.js

The included `/app/lib/http.js` library is used to make HTTP requests and includes support for
the most-used functionality. The HTTP library also adds some bonuses, such as data pass-through,
which lets you send identifying information along with the HTTP request and receive it in the
data return callback, helping associate data return with data requests.

##### utilities.js

A growing list of utility helper methods are available in the `/app/lib/utilities.js` file.
These include:

 * File existance
 * Number formatting
 * HEX to HSB color conversion
 * String cleaning, escaping, decoding and translating

Ti.mocha Tests
===================
You can toggle the ti.mocha tests in `demo_app/app/config.json` -> mochaTesting
